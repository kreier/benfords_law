# Benford's law
Some math statistics application in python

This work is inspired by Matt Parker ([Stand-up Maths](https://standupmaths.com/)) video "[Why do Biden's votes not follow Benford's Law?](https://youtu.be/etx0k1nLn78?si=qWTPNqYUe9_z5BcN)" from November 2020.

## Distribution for Benford's law

Still to be done ...

## Random distribution of last two digits

I tried to rework the distribution of the last two digits from the Pi digits for the first 2069 places. (see 13:18 in the video to get a random verifiable distribution)

My reference result should look like this:
